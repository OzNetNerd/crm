# CRM UI Testing Progress

## Test Session Started: 2025-09-18

### Testing Approach
- Using Playwright to test each unique UI element
- Fixing issues as they are discovered
- Restarting server after fixes to verify solutions

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing entity_cards.html template (âœ… Fixed)
- **Location**: `/companies` page
- **Error**: `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: entity_cards.html`
- **Impact**: Companies page fails to load content with 500 error
- **File**: `app/routes/web/entities.py:146`
- **Fix**: Changed template to `shared/entity_content.html` and added missing context variables
- **Server restart**: Auto-reloaded at 08:24:00

- **Impact**: Console error but functionality still works
- **Fix**: Created missing `modal-handlers.js` file with Alpine.js modal component

### Issue 3: Stakeholder creation backend error (âœ… Fixed)
- **Location**: `/stakeholders` - Create stakeholder form
- **Error**: `'str' object has no attribute '_sa_instance_state'`
- **Impact**: Cannot create stakeholders when company is selected
- **Fix**: Modified `process_form_submission` in `modals.py` to handle company field as relationship
- **Server restart**: Auto-reloaded successfully

### Issue 4: Opportunity creation backend error (âœ… Fixed)
- **Location**: `/opportunities` - Create opportunity form
- **Error**: `'str' object has no attribute '_sa_instance_state'`
