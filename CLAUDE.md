# CRM Application - Claude Code Instructions

## Running the Application

### Auto Port Detection (Recommended)
```bash
./run.sh
```
- Automatically finds the first free port starting from 5000
- Displays the URL Claude should use: `http://127.0.0.1:{port}`
- Perfect for multiple worktrees - no port conflicts!

### Manual Port Selection
```bash
python3 main.py --port 5002
```
- Use when you need a specific port
- If port is busy, will show helpful error message

## For Claude Code

When starting the CRM application:
1. Run `./run.sh` (recommended - auto-detects port)
2. Look for the output: `ðŸš€ Starting CRM application on http://127.0.0.1:{port}`
3. Use that URL to access the application

## Features

- **Automatic Port Detection**: No more port conflicts between worktrees
- **Smart Error Messages**: Clear guidance when ports are busy  
- **Flexible**: Can still specify ports manually when needed
- **Claude-Friendly**: Clear URL output for automated tools

## Development Workflow

### Multiple Worktrees
Each worktree can run simultaneously:
```bash
# Worktree 1
./run.sh  # Uses port 5000

# Worktree 2  
./run.sh  # Uses port 5001 (auto-detected)

# Worktree 3
./run.sh  # Uses port 5002 (auto-detected)
```

### Testing Specific Ports
```bash
python3 main.py --port 8080  # Force specific port
```
